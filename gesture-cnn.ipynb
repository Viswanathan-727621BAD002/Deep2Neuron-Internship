The gestures are quite distinct, the images are clear, and there's no background whatsoever to worry about. If you weren't comfortable with deep learning, you could do quite well with some straight-forward feature detection -- for example the '07_ok' class could easily be detected with binary thresholding followed by circle detection. \n\nMoreover, the gestures consistently occupy only about 25% of the image, and all would fit snugly inside a square bounding box. Again if you're looking to do basic feature detection, an easy first step would be to write a short script cropping everything to the relevant 120 x 120 square. \n\nBut the point of this notebook is to show how effective it is to just throw a neural network at a problem like this without having to worry about any of the above, so that's what we're going to do. \n\nAt the moment our vector `y_data` has shape `(datacount, 1)`, with `y_data[i,0] = j` if the `i`th image in our dataset is of gesture `reverselookup[j]`.
